#Ember Project Guidelines

##Timeline
 - Start Wednesday, Jun 15
 - Science Fair for BOTH Projects (Ember and the last Rails one): Tuesday 1PM, Jun 21
 - You can form your groups and start brainstorming today. We will not have a big pitch ceremony, but the instructors will speak with each group individually to scope the ideas

##Requirements
 - >= 3 models
 - Rails API (using ActiveModel::Serializer)
 - Full CRUD actions are strongly recommended (instructor should approve an exception to this)
 - No complex themes. Bootswatch.com themes should suffice. 

##Daily Schedule
 - Most days we will follow the schedule below. However, 
  - Steven will do "edge lectures" for interesting topics (e.g. Auth in Ember).
  - There will be speaker & placements talks periodically. We will let you know about them in advance.
