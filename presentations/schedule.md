# Presentations

## Purpose

The purpose of the Flatiron Student Presents presentations are for you to take ownership of a project that you build with your own steam––no tests or instructions!––for you to work together with a partner and for you to experience presenting at a tech meetup. In that spirit, the projects you undertake should be relatively small scale and very concrete––if you plan to spend more than 4-5 days on this project and presentation prep, then your project is too large-scale for this purpose.

## Guidelines

Approach your presentation like a technical talk. Pick a topic you are interested in exploring––Sinatra, object-oriented design patterns, Rails form helpers, you name it––and build a small application or program that helps you to explore one aspect of it. For example, you may be interested in how routing works in Sinatra. If so, build a simple app that implements REST-ful routes. Or, you may be interested in working with an external API as a source of data. If so, build a simple app that hits an API, gets data and delivers it to the user. Then, your presentation should explain the topic you explored, how you explored it and what you learned and some avenues for future development. The bottom line is: keep it simple!
